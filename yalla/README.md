# YALLA: an LL library for Rocq

## Yet Another deep embedding of Linear Logic in the Rocq Prover



If you have any trouble, question or request for extension, if you need help to write interfaces,
please contact:  `Olivier.Laurent@ens-lyon.fr`


This library defines notions of proofs for various fragments of linear logic.
It provides some general results such as cut admissibility.

The formalisation is based on sequents as lists together with an explicit exchange rule.
This allows us to provide a study of proofs which is compatible with the computational interpretation of proofs.

Parameters in the definition of proofs allow the user:

* to include the `mix0` rule or not;
* to include the `mix2` rule or not;
* to define arbitrary axioms
     (which allows in particular to work with open proofs);
* to use the usual exchange rule (arbitrary permutations)
   or to restrict to cyclic linear logic (cyclic permutations only).

This library is probably not so appropriate to build LL proofs by hands, but is more dedicated to the study of meta-properties of linear logic fragments.

Because of the parameters, the proof predicates defined in the library should not be used directly.
We recommend the user to define his own objects (inductive types for formulas and proofs) and to interface them with the library in order to then import the results of the library in his lighter setting (examples of such interfaces are provided in the files mell2.v and lambek.v).
It is possible to hide the explicit exchange rule by introducing multisets for sequents (see mell_mset.v).
