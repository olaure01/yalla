*Tested with Coq v8.19.*

## Version 2.0.4 (2023/04/09)

This is mostly an adaptation of v2.0 to Coq v8.17 and OLlibs v2.0.4.

*Tested with Coq v8.16 - 8.18.*

## Version 2.0.3 (2022/02/06)

## Version 2.0 (2019/01/23)

This major revision is based on a representation of proofs in `Type` rather than `Prop`.
For this reason it is *not compatible with v1.0*.

Many results have been added, including:

* general cut admissibility proof for Intuitionistic Linear Logic;
* more general conservativity results for Classical Linear Logic over Intuitionistic Linear Logic;
* theory of focusing;
* example files for additional related systems;
* definition of the microyalla kernel.

*Tested with Coq v8.9.*

## Version 1.0 (2017/07/18)

First public release.
